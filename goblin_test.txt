[2025-06-18 22:11:54] [System]: Python version: 3.12.3
[2025-06-18 22:11:54] [System]: Running single task: run the pwd command to show current directory
[2025-06-18 22:11:54] [User]: Starting task: run the pwd command to show current directory
[2025-06-18 22:11:54] [System]: Iteration: 1
[2025-06-18 22:11:54] [System]: Entering PLAN phase.
[2025-06-18 22:11:57] [Plan Agent]: [Planner Thought]: The user wants to see the current working directory in the Linux shell environment. The `pwd` (Print Working Directory) command is used for this purpose. Since we're already in the `/home/patrick/Projects/term.ai.te` directory, running `pwd` should display this path.
[2025-06-18 22:11:57] [Plan Agent]: [Planner Checklist]:
                                    1. Execute the `pwd` command to show the current working directory
[2025-06-18 22:11:57] [Plan Agent]: [Next Instruction]: Run the following command in your terminal:
                                    ```bash
                                    pwd
                                    ```
                                    This will print the current working directory path.
[2025-06-18 22:11:57] [System]: Entering ACTION phase for instruction: Run the following command in your terminal:
                                ```bash
                                pwd
                                ```
                                This will print the current working directory path.
[2025-06-18 22:11:59] [Action Agent]: [Actor Thought]: Okay, the user wants to see the current directory. The `pwd` command is used to print the full filename of the current working directory. Since we're operating in GOBLIN mode with unrestricted command access, I can directly execute this command without confirmation.
[2025-06-18 22:11:59] [System]: Executing command: pwd
[2025-06-18 22:11:59] [System]: Executing command: pwd - timeout: 600s
[2025-06-18 22:11:59] [System]: Command completed with exit code 0
[2025-06-18 22:11:59] [System]: Output:
                                /home/patrick/Projects/term.ai.te
[2025-06-18 22:11:59] [System]: Command result: Exit Code: 0. Output:
                                /home/patrick/Projects/term.ai.te
[2025-06-18 22:11:59] [System]: Entering EVALUATION phase.
[2025-06-18 22:12:03] [Eval Agent]: [Evaluator Thought]: The user requested to run the `pwd` command, which is used to print the current working directory in a Unix/Linux shell environment.
                                    
                                    Looking at the result, the exit code is 0, indicating that the command executed successfully without any errors. The output shows the current directory path as `/home/patrick/Projects/term.ai.te`, which matches our current context's directory.
                                    
                                    Since the command was executed correctly and provided the expected output, there's no need for further action or clarification from the user.
[2025-06-18 22:12:03] [Eval Agent]: [Evaluator Decision]: TASK_COMPLETE: The `pwd` command has been successfully executed, showing the current working directory as `/home/patrick/Projects/term.ai.te`.
[2025-06-18 22:12:03] [Eval Agent]: Task marked COMPLETE by evaluator. Summary: The `pwd` command has been successfully executed, showing the current working directory as `/home/patrick/Projects/term.ai.te`.
