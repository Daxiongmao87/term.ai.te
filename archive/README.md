This directory contains obsolete versions of files that are no longer actively maintained.

## Files

- `termaite.sh` - Original bash implementation of term.ai.te. This has been superseded by the Python implementation (`termaite.py`) which provides the same functionality with better maintainability and features.

The bash version is kept here for historical reference and in case any specific bash-only functionality needs to be referenced in the future.
